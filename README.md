# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction App

## Mission & Problem
## Problem
Colonic diseases, often remain undetected until advanced stages, leading to severe complications and reduced treatment options. Early detection is critical, yet many individuals lack access to timely risk assessment tools.

## Mission
My mission is to reduce the complications associated with late-detected colonic diseases by providing accessible, data-driven risk assessment through using digital tools. 


## Public API Endpoint
A publicly available API for cardiovascular risk prediction is provided and can be tested via Swagger UI:

**API Endpoint:**  
[`https://cardio-prediction-q5ny.onrender.com/docs`](https://cardio-prediction-q5ny.onrender.com/docs)  
- `/predict` — Returns risk predictions given input values.
- `/guides` — Returns health recommendations based on risk score.
